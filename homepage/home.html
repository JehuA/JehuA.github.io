		<p>

			The purpose of this website is for me to get better at a few things,
			<ul>
				<li> HTML (and most likely CSS) </li>
				<li>  Markdown </li>
				<li> Javascript  </li>
				<li> Vim  </li>
				<li> Basic Web Dev stuff </li>
			</ul>

			Of course this will host a plethora of things for me to share and enjoy.
			This may include work related things such as my resume but also I hope
			to share some cool tips and tricks such as my own vimrc, cool articles,
			and many other things. But at the moment this is very barebones.
		
			<h3 id="about-me" style="color:#ff79c6">About Me</h3>
			<p>My name is Jehu Ananoria. If this website has elvis as part of its URL, then I am still a student of Rowan University.
			If not that means I have graduate and moved on to the real world. Regardless of what has happened,
			I just want to say hello and welcome to my page. 
			As you can see, I am not the most verbose person. But I will be if I feel like I have to on certain pages. Right now,
			I think I can ramble for a bit and have a little fun with spewing out nonsense.</p>
			<p>A few of my hobbies are</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Video Games</li>
			<li>Martial Arts (Muay Thai)</li>
			<li>Tinkering with Linux</li>
			<li>Just some general programming</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="faith" style="color:#ff79c6;" > Faith</h3>
			<p>I am indeed a Christian and I am part of Rowan&#39;s Chi Alpha. It is not a frat despite the name,
			but here is a link to the website for those interested 
			<a href="https://www.ruxa.org" style="color:#8be9fd"> Rowan Chi Alpha</a>.
			If you are viewing this outside of Rowan University, then 
			<a href="https://chialpha.com" style="color:#8be9fd">National Chi Alpha</a> 
			is what you should click instead. You can probably find a chapter you can join there.</p>

			<h3 style="color:#ff79c6"> Colorscheme </h3>
			<p>
				The colorscheme that I personal use in all my work environments,
				including terminals, IDEs, text editors, and wherever I can is
				called <b style="color:#50fa7b;"> Dracula </b >.
				It keeps everything very color coordinated and unlike other
				colorschemes, such as Monokai and Gruvbox,
				is that it is bother pleasing to the eye and also readable.
				I find that my eyes love the contrasting yet gentle colors.
				The colorscheme and its hex codes are available online
				and it is what I use inside my code for the website.
				<br>
				<br>
				If this color scheme is not your cup of tea, then
				I do recommend Nord or One Dark. Nord is very easy on the
				eyes and One Dark has amazing contrast!
