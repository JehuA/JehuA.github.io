    <h1>
        The World
    </h1>

    <p class="intro">
        Everfar was a world in the making for a while and has started off as a homebrew DnD campaign
        and will continue to evolve as I continue to create more and more stories for it.


        As generic as the world is now, I plan on creating much more lore. This will take place in the more one offs
        and off shoot stories that I create in my own time. I appreciate being called out for any inconsistencies in
        the world and would like to open up writing to certain people with moderation.
    </p>
    
    <p class="stories">
        Stories tend to be one off. They come into the form of either full stories, which will be rare.
        The more common ways will be through small short stories or through lore entries.
        The hardest thing to do is creating a database or a way to store everything. I really
        do not trust Google Drive to take care of everything and may try to find a way to
        host them elsewhere.

    </p>

    <p class="completed">
        What has been completed so far has been Everfar, the continent. Everfar is the name
        of the entire world and the name of a continent. At the moment, just the continent has
        been "finished". It is still subject to change and settlements has not been solidified.
